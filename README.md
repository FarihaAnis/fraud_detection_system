# Fraud Detection System

## ðŸ“Œ Business Problem  
Fraud detection in financial institutions is **manual and inefficient**, requiring **10+ hours daily** to review transactions. As trading volumes grow, **manual reviews become impractical**, leading to **delays in fraud detection and increased operational costs**. The reliance on manual checks **increases the risk of human error**, making the system **prone to false negatives**, where fraudulent transactions go undetected. Additionally, **manual processes are not scalable**, meaning compliance teams **struggle to keep up with high transaction volumes**, leaving financial institutions vulnerable to **fraudulent activities and regulatory risks**. ðŸš¨

## ðŸš€ Solution  
This **automated fraud detection system** eliminates inefficiencies by **analyzing transaction patterns and assigning risk levels in minutes**. The system:  
âœ… **Uses Machine Learning (LightGBM)** to classify transactions as **High, Medium, Low, or No Risk**.  
âœ… **Processes 50,000 accounts** in **5-10 minutes**, compared to **10+ hours of manual work daily**.  
âœ… **Automates fraud detection** using a **Flask-based backend** connected to a **MySQL database**.  
âœ… **Provides a React.js dashboard** for **fraud monitoring**, including **sortable tables, risk charts, and fraud reports** for quick decision-making.  
âœ… **Generates fraud risk summaries** using AI (Llama3) to explain why an account was flagged.  
âœ… **Enables fraud reporting** by allowing compliance teams to **generate fraud reports in PDF format** for further investigation.  

By replacing **error-prone manual reviews with an automated risk assessment**, this system **significantly reduces false negatives, enhances fraud detection accuracy, and scales effortlessly with increasing transaction volumes**. ðŸš€
